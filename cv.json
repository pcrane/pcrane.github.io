Depending on the technology and underlying method of location estimate the accuracy is variable.  This thesis examines ways to increase the accuracy of indoor localisation systems focusing on using ubiquitous technologies. Two popular methods for indoor localisation, fingerprinting and trilateration, were investigated.",
          "The improvement to the fingerprint location accuracy is approximately 85% and was achieved by excluding poor quality measurements through the manipulation of the radio hardware transmission powers. The trilateration scheme location accuracy was improved by 32% accompanied by a decrease in computation time by 70% in general, and up to two orders of magnitude in some cases.",
          "One problem with these popular indoor localisation methods is the need for a large amount of training data. To counter this a crowd-sourced approach was developed to decrease the amount of time taken to deploy a localisation system while improving the accuracy by 25% with state- of-the-art systems."

On a technical level this involved: working with guidelines (as opposed to requirements), great attention to detail (to ensure the experiment's parameters were correctly set), and multiple languages (forced by availability of hardware interfaces or matching an existing code-based).",

Due to the nature of the data collection, the measurements (recorded at 128Hz for the entire duration of the experiment---around 45min) and markers were stored as they occurred, i.e. by timestamp. This lead to an inefficient naive import process (each file took two hours to import). By reordering the file so that the markers appeared before the EEG data the import process took only 6 seconds."

Using a RaspberryPI, a small battery powered UPS (UPS PIco), and monitoring of the system (including CPU, RAM, hard disk) allowed us to keep tabs on the performance of the devices in the field. The RaspberryPI was connected to a wall-mounted TV in the offices to display the content.

The devices need to continue to work in adverse conditions (for example, avoiding file system corruption or crashing) while displaying timely updates of the content. Raspberry PI with a PIco UPS Hat are used to provide a safe shutdown solution, while message queues provide timely content updates as well as remote device monitoring (and assisting with reliability).",

The design of the new gloves achieved a sample rate of 125Hz (matching the existing pair), while improving upon the comfort level across a variety of different hand sizes and shapes.",

        "Recording fine-grained movements of hands and fingers is important to be able to differentiate Essential Tremor from Parkinson's Disease,  the two diseases are easy to misdiagnose because they share common symptoms. Previously Accelegloves were being used for this purpose, however, there are two main problems with these devices. The first is that they are no longer being manufactured, and the second is the gloves cannot fit every hand.",
        "I was tasked with designing, prototyping, and developing a replacement pair of gloves that could record the fine-grained movements while being suitable for a wide range of hand sizes and shapes. Furthermore, the sample rate needed to be as close to the existing as possible (125Hz)",
        "These goals were accomplished by using velcro strips to attach accelerometers to the fingers, along with a multiplexing approach to retrieving data over the I2C bus from multiple accelerometers at the same time. Obtaining measurements from a single accelerometer took 250Hz, however using a naive loop brought the sample rate down to only 25Hz (further complicated by the accelerometers using only one of two pre-programmed addresses), the multiplexed approach produced a sample rate of 125Hz.",
        "Several studies have used the gloves, one of which was to analyse every-day tasks (such as writing, turning a door knob, buttoning and unbuttoning a shirt). "
