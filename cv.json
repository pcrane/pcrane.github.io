Depending on the technology and underlying method of location estimate the accuracy is variable.  This thesis examines ways to increase the accuracy of indoor localisation systems focusing on using ubiquitous technologies. Two popular methods for indoor localisation, fingerprinting and trilateration, were investigated.",
          "The improvement to the fingerprint location accuracy is approximately 85% and was achieved by excluding poor quality measurements through the manipulation of the radio hardware transmission powers. The trilateration scheme location accuracy was improved by 32% accompanied by a decrease in computation time by 70% in general, and up to two orders of magnitude in some cases.",
          "One problem with these popular indoor localisation methods is the need for a large amount of training data. To counter this a crowd-sourced approach was developed to decrease the amount of time taken to deploy a localisation system while improving the accuracy by 25% with state- of-the-art systems."

Current research suggests that a hemispheric difference in activity of the pre-frontal areas of the brain can be used as a marker of depression.",

On a technical level this involved: working with guidelines (as opposed to requirements), great attention to detail (to ensure the experiment's parameters were correctly set), and multiple languages (forced by availability of hardware interfaces or matching an existing code-based).",
        "There were several key challenges encountered, the major challenge was to ensure the offline data import process was fast. Due to the nature of the data collection, the measurements (recorded at 128Hz for the entire duration of the experiment---around 45min) and markers were stored as they occurred, i.e. by timestamp. This lead to an inefficient naive import process (each file took two hours to import). By reordering the file so that the markers appeared before the EEG data the import process took only 6 seconds."

Using a RaspberryPI, a small battery powered UPS (UPS PIco), and monitoring of the system (including CPU, RAM, hard disk) allowed us to keep tabs on the performance of the devices in the field. The RaspberryPI was connected to a wall-mounted TV in the offices to display the content.

The devices need to continue to work in adverse conditions (for example, avoiding file system corruption or crashing) while displaying timely updates of the content.
