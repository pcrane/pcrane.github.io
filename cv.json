Current research suggests that a hemispheric difference in activity of the pre-frontal areas of the brain can be used as a marker of depression.",
        "My tasks on this project was to, gather data from in-house EEG devices, process the data and present the participant with a display that reacted to the current asymmetry. On a technical level this involved: working with guidelines (as opposed to requirements), great attention to detail (to ensure the experiment's parameters were correctly set), and multiple languages (forced by availability of hardware interfaces or matching an existing code-based).",
        "There were several key challenges encountered, the major challenge was to ensure the offline data import process was fast. Due to the nature of the data collection, the measurements (recorded at 128Hz for the entire duration of the experiment---around 45min) and markers were stored as they occurred, i.e. by timestamp. This lead to an inefficient naive import process (each file took two hours to import). By reordering the file so that the markers appeared before the EEG data the import process took only 6 seconds."

Because the information is being displayed in their client's premises and in public areas, the priority of requirements were thus: reliability, functionality, then cost. Using a RaspberryPI, a small battery powered UPS (UPS PIco), and monitoring of the system (including CPU, RAM, hard disk) allowed us to keep tabs on the performance of the devices in the field. The RaspberryPI was connected to a wall-mounted TV in the offices to display the content. Controlling the devices was done through the use of message queues and a web-based administration interface.",

The core of the project revolved around the reliability of the devices being deployed. The devices need to continue to work in adverse conditions (for example, avoiding file system corruption or crashing) while displaying timely updates of the content. Raspberry PI with a PIco UPS Hat are used to provide a safe shutdown solution, while message queues provide timely content updates as well as remote device monitoring (and assisting with reliability).",

The course was last revised in 2010 and has been kept (mostly) up-to-date in the interim (and forms a small part of the duties of the demonstrator for the paper). However, over this period there have been a number of changes to commands (and their output), tools (ifconfig vs ip) and general practises surrounding Linux Sysadmin.",

Furthermore, as the writing was aimed towards undergraduate students, the instructions needed to be clear and unambiguous, and descriptions contain enough detail needed to ensure the students gained a good understanding while not being extremely verbose.",

These include electricity monitoring, heating, ventilation and cooling equipment, lighting sensors, and occupancy details. To support the day-to-day Energy Management, long term strategic planning, and research interests these data sources need to be integrated into one platform that can be used to measure minute performance improvements at the same time as providing broad trends.",
        "My role in this project was to design, develop and implement a system fulfilling these goals. Some pre-processing is necessary to ensure the measurements can remain useful. This pre-processing includes steps such as: ensuring the date/time stamps are all in the same time zone, the measurements are tagged (following Project Haystack conventions). The tags include the source, sink, and type of energy (e.g. electricity, gas, wood pellet, etc.), the units associated with the measurements. The measurements? are sent to a message queue and stored in a time series database. The message queue is designed to allow for future work with real-time notification/alerting and complex event processing. Furthermore, the concept of an 'energy flow graph' is important, as it allows us to estimate the energy usage for a wide variety of geographic levels of detail (from the physical level: room, floor, building, school; to the administrative level: departments, schools, faculties, divisions, campuses).",

The first is that they are no longer being manufactured, and the second is the gloves cannot fit every hand.",

Obtaining measurements from a single accelerometer took 250Hz, however using a naive loop brought the sample rate down to only 25Hz (further complicated by the accelerometers using only one of two pre-programmed addresses), the multiplexed approach produced a sample rate of 125Hz.",
