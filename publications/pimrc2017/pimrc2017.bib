  abstract="Indoor localisation systems have slowly become more and more accurate. Each
  localisation system needs tuning to affect reasonable performance. In this
  paper we propose CRAFT, a crowd sourced approach to constructing a WiFi
  fingerprint database. The method uses a temporarily deployment of a small
  number of anchor nodes to roughly locate the position of the WiFi sample.
  Through thorough experiments in a real-world building, CRAFT's error is
  2.2m a decrease of 25\% when compare to other published results."
