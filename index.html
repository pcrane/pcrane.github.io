            <p>The Department of Computer Science is a small department composed of 14 full-time academic staff, six service staff, and three teaching fellows.

                Formal teaching evaluations were 'pretty outstanding [...] with a very good response rate'. All core teaching questions scored median values in the top two levels. The following are some of the comments students left on the evaluation forms anonymously<ul>
                        <li>I really enjoyed how open Paul was to answering questions. He was also very knowledgeable about the subject which is always helpful.</li>
                        <li>Really good communicator, going to Paul's lectures always feels valuable and his verbal explanations help a lot with unpacking and understanding the concepts, really appreciate his depth of explanation in lectures and his patience and thoroughness when helping us in labs</li>
                        <li>Paul has a great attitude about the topic and is obviously very passionate about it. I enjoy his teaching style and the way that he interacts with the students. He is also very helpful after class if you have any questions. He is very receptive to students who show enthusiasm on the topics and he meets them with a similar attitude. Having a teacher who is also engaged in the student’s learning is rare and makes for a better learning environment.</li>

            <p>The Downer Group is a company involved in civil infrastructure works across Australia and New Zealand. I designed, developed, tested, deployed and maintained a novel containerised digital signage application to push (in realtime) a wide range of relevant up-to-date content to remote display clients around the country while maintaining integrity and security of the data. Briefly, the application consisted of an AndroidThings client application; a message queue for control commands; a web application and associated database for administration of devices, content hosting, and data gathering and parsing (via asynchronous task queues); and, public key infrastructure to authenticate remote clients.</p>

    <p>Indoor localisation systems are concerned with locating people or devices indoors without the support of GPS. A key challenge is to derive accurate location estimates. The thesis explores, and improves upon, the accuracy of two different signal strength based approaches. The final contribution is to reduce the effort needed to deploy an indoor localisation system via crowd sourcing.</p><h3 class="ui header">MSc (Thesis Only) with Credit

    <p>The thesis is an examination of the use of rapidly deployable cell-phone networks for disaster relief efforts. During a disaster, effective communications are vital to coordinate response efforts and to keep civilians informed. We propose and test a system that is aimed at use by civilians without the need for them to have any special equipment apart from a GSM mobile phone.</p><h3 class="ui header">Postgraduate Diploma in Science, with Distinction
